## Objectives:

1. **Analyzing Trends Across Neighborhoods to Identify Underlying Factors**
   Leverage unsupervised learning methods to uncover hidden patterns in the 311 data and compare it with Pittsburghâ€™s neighborhood data. By analyzing trends across neighborhoods and incorporating additional factors such as demographics, infrastructure, and local conditions, we can identify the root causes of varying closure times and call volumes.
2. **Predicting How Long it Will Take to Address Requests**
   By using machine learning algorithms, such as regression models or time series analysis, we can estimate the closure time for each new service request based on factors such as request type, neighborhood, department, and other factors. This predictive model will allow city agencies to anticipate the resources needed to address specific issues and allocate personnel, equipment, and budget accordingly. The outcome variable used here is time_taken.
3. **Forecasting the Number of Future Service Requests**
   As requests vary seasonally, we plan to analyze past data on the frequency and types of requests in previous years or months to identify recurring patterns or anomalies. These forecasts will enable municipalities and service departments to anticipate periods of higher demand and plan accordingly. The outcome variable used would be the number of future service requests in a specific time frame, categorised by request type.
